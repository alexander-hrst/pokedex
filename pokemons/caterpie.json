  "description": "Caterpie is a Pokémon that resembles a green caterpillar. There yellow ring-shaped markings down the sides of its body, which resemble its large yellow eyes. Its most notable characteristic is the bright red antenna (osmeterium) on its head, which releases a stench to repel predators. This structure and the large eye-shaped markings help to startle predators. Its feet are tipped with suction cups, permitting this Pokémon to scale most surfaces with minimal effort."
