  "description": "Rattata is a small, quadruped rodent Pok√©mon. Its most notable feature is its large teeth. Like most rodents, its teeth grow continuously throughout its life and must be worn down by gnawing. It has long whiskers and a long, slightly curled tail. Rattata has purple fur on its back, and cream fur on its stomach. Females have shorter whiskers and lighter fur color."
