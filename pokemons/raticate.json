  "description": "Raticate is a large, rodent Pok√©mon. Although it is often depicted on its hind legs, it is a quadruped. It is mostly tawny colored with a cream underside. It has large incisors that grow constantly. These teeth are strong enough to gnaw through steel. There are three whiskers on each side of its face, which it uses to maintain balance. Females will have shorter whiskers and lighter fur. It has webbed feet with three toes that allow it to swim. Its tail is long and scaly, and its ears have a ragged appearance."
